                <p class="text-justify">The Polish Studentsâ€™s Society at Yale is an organization uniting all Polish people associated with Yale university as well as promoting Polish culture among all community members at Yale. We aim to celebrate Polish heritage of both Polish students studying abroad in the United States as well as those with Polish-American backgrounds. We welcome all undergraduates, graduates and post-graduates to come to our weekly dinners and special events, which include meetings with guest speakers, food tasting, theater evenings, and movie screenings. Knowledge of Polish is not necessary :)</p>
